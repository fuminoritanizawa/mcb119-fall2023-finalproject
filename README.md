# mcb119-fall2023-finalproject

Fall 2023 MathCompBio119 Coursework: MATLAB Coding for Lambda Phage Virus Analysis. Focused on mathematical models from Hasty et al. 2001 (doi: 10.1063/1.1345702), specifically examining rcsA concentration effects on c1-cro interactions in lambda phage, indicative of the lytic vs. lysogenic growth decision. Collaborated with Ethan Goroza (Harvey Mudd, Class of 2025).

- mcb_final_2023fall_main.m is the final version of the simulation.
- mcb_final_2023fall.m is the simpler version without the sidebar of gamma_xt and x0.
- Others are functions; refer to the headline of codes.
