# mcb119-fall2023-finalproject
My coursework MATLAB codes for MathCompBio119 class in Fall 2023, analyzing mathematical models of lambda phage viruses. Based on Hasty et al. 2001 (doi: 10.1063/1.1345702), analyzed the impact of rcsA concentration on the c1-cro interactions, which is a proxy for decision-making between lytic growth and lysogenic state of lambda phage. Teammate: Ethan Goroza (Harvey Mudd, 2025)

- mcb_final_2023fall_main.m is the final version of the simulation.
- mcb_final_2023fall.m is the simpler version without the sidebar of gamma_xt and x0.
- Others are functions; refer to the headline of codes.
