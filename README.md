My coursework MATLAB codes for MathCompBio119 class in Fall 2023, analyzing mathematical model of lambda phage viruses. Based on Hasty et al. 2001 (doi: 10.1063/1.1345702), analyzed the impact of rcsA concentration on c1-cro interactions, which is a proxy for a decision making between lytic growth and lysogenic state of lambda phage.
